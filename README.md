# Text Editor code by C
## This is a project for my Data Structure and Algorithms

**How to use it?** <br>
I use C for this project, so the only required thing is *GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)* to run the code<br>
**What can this Text Editor do?**
- Edit text, save, open old files to continue editing
- Can undo, redo (I set the code to undo and redo 10 times, you guys can change the code to extend)
**NOTE:** <br>
- *.txt* files are input or outputs of the code, you should read the code in *text_editor_oriented.cpp* to understane their usage.
- I do not say much about the code here, but in code I have explain everything.

**Any question? Be free to contact me**
